Dubbi:
1. Dropout layer in CNN
2. Which output layers must be retrained in order to reuse the model for custom classification (transfer learning).
   For example, InceptionResnetV1 has intermediate classification layers, are these already trained or must them be retrained? 
   (from paper: At inference time, these auxiliary networks are discarded)
